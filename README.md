**DEPRECATED**: This theme isn't updated anymore. With Jenkins 2.333 (or LTS
2.346.1), Jenkins has gotten a new set of icons, which are fine for me, so I
won't maintain this theme anymore.

Beautify your Jenkins with the a modern flat theme!

Website: https://tobix.github.io/jenkins-neo2-theme

This started as a fork to **jenkins-neo-theme**, which itself started as a fork
to the **jenkins-material-theme**, but was developed further to work correctly
with modern versions of Jenkins.


## Features

* Just one css file
* Embed minified SVG images
* Multiple ways to install

## Installation

If you want to keep using an older release, replace `/dist/` in all URLs with
an older version, for example `/v0.2.0/`.

2. Click `Manage Jenkins`

3. Click `Configure System` and scroll down to `Theme`

4. Specify the URL for `https://tobix.github.io/jenkins-neo2-theme/dist/neo-light.css`.

5. Click `Save`


### Using your Jenkins Hosting

1. Copy the file
   `https://tobix.github.io/jenkins-neo2-theme/dist/neo-light.css` to the
   directory `userContent` in your `JENKINS_HOME`

2. Follow the steps of the previous method and use `/userContent/neo-light.css`
   as the URL.


## Development

CSS file are minified and compressed with Grunt. If you have Node & yarn
installed, you can build everything with:

```
yarn test
```

This will generate the following file:

- dist/neo-light.css

## Compatibility

- Current Simple Theme plugin
- Current Jenkins LTS (older versions might still work, but compatibility isn't
  guaranteed)
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Microsoft IE11 and Edge (IE & Edge support isn't tested regularly)
